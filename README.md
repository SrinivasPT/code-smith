# code-smith

This repository contains a VS Code extension (`extension/`) and a companion webview app (`webview/`). The goal is to refine Jira stories into code plans and implementations using LLM-driven features (clarifications, plan generation, execution helpers, and refinement flows).

GitHub Copilot is configured to follow repository conventions for consistent, type-safe suggestions. See the docs below for guidance.
